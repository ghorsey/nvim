# Overview

This is my initial recreation of my neovim setup.  It was basically copied over from
[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/plugins/util) because I wanted to have a good baseline but with
access to all of the code so that I can learn what the heck is going on.


## Prerequisites

### Lazygit

This is a terminal gui over the top of the git cli.

#### Installation Windows

`winget install jesseduffield/lazygit`

#### Installation Mac/Linux

`homebrew install lazygit`
